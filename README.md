# Jocelyn-Bio-Readme
Hi, my name is Jocelyn, and I'm excited to learn how to use GitHub. I like to learn about and open to learn about anything within the STEM field but I mostly like to learn about architecture .

By learning to use GitHub, I hope to achieve the following goals:
- Collaborate effectively on projects with others.
- Build a portfolio of my projects and contributions.
- Learn best practices in software development and project management.
